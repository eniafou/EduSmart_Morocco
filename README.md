## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement
High school teachers, particularly in mathematics, face challenges in effectively assessing individual student understanding, identifying specific weaknesses, and creating personalized learning paths. Moreover, tracking improvement and developing data-driven teaching strategies is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This lack of scalable, data-driven solutions limits the overall educational outcomes.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
EduPulse addresses these challenges by providing an AI-powered platform that automates assessment, delivers personalized learning experiences, and enables data-driven decision-making. By focusing on a cycle of diagnosis, intervention, and improvement, EduPulse transforms student data into actionable insights, helping educators improve outcomes at both individual and institutional levels.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables
The project delivers:
1. A diagnostic survey system for targeted assessments.
2. AI-generated personalized learning materials.
3. Progress tracking for individual students.
4. Teacher dashboards for detailed analytics.
5. School-wide analytics for strategic decision-making.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.12.3 installed.
2. **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.

### Steps

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables
- **Backend (.env for `edusmart`):**  
  Create a `.env` file inside the `./edusmart` directory with the following content:  
  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-***"
  ```
  Replace `sk-***` with your OpenAI API key. You can refer to `.env.prod` for an example.

- **Frontend (.env for `frontend`):**  
  Create a `.env` file inside the `./frontend` directory with the following content:  
  ```env
  VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
  venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
  ```
- Install the required dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Start the backend server:  
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

#### 3. Set Up Frontend
- Navigate to the `./frontend` directory.  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
